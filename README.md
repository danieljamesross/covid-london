## TEST â€¢ DATA VISUALISATION

# The effect of Covid 19 across London Boroughs

### Brief
We would like you to produce a piece of work that visualises the number of Covid
19 cases across London over time.

To achieve this you should select an appropriate technical solution, either a
web-based (eg React, Angular, Vue etc.) or application-based (eg
Observable/Jupyter, Processing, Electron etc.) platform, to present this data in
a creative and visually engaging way.

Bonus points for integrating search methods, allowing user-defined parameters for exploring the data further, or having interactions such as being able to scrub through the timeline.

### Assets supplied by Phantom
We have attached a CSV of case data across the boroughs during 2020 to use as a starting point. This data was sourced from data.london.gov.uk

### Deliverables
To produce a working application by the deadline of the morning of 15/7.

The work should:
- Be available for analysis by the Phantom team on a Git repo of your choosing
- Have instruction for setup and running on a Mac/Linux machine
- Be publicly hosted, if applicable (eg. Netlify, Vercel, Heroku..)
- Be ready to talk about the process involved in coming to your delivered experience.
