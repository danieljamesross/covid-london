<h2 id="the-effect-of-covid-19-across-london-boroughs">The effect of Covid 19 across London Boroughs</h2>
<h3 id="brief">Brief</h3>
<p>We would like you to produce a piece of work that visualises the number of Covid 19 cases across London over time.</p>
<p>To achieve this you should select an appropriate technical solution, either a web-based (eg React, Angular, Vue etc.) or application-based (eg Observable/Jupyter, Processing, Electron etc.) platform, to present this data in a creative and visually engaging way.</p>
<p>Bonus points for integrating search methods, allowing user-defined parameters for exploring the data further, or having interactions such as being able to scrub through the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="assets-supplied-by-phantom">Assets supplied by Phantom</h3>
<p>We have attached a CSV of case data across the boroughs during 2020 to use as a starting point. This data was sourced from data.london.gov.uk</p>
<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>
<p>To produce a working application by the deadline of the morning of 15/7.</p>
<p>The work should: - Be available for analysis by the Phantom team on a Git repo of your choosing - Have instruction for setup and running on a Mac/Linux machine - Be publicly hosted, if applicable (eg. Netlify, Vercel, Heroku..) - Be ready to talk about the process involved in coming to your delivered experience.</p>
